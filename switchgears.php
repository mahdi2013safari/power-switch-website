                    <h5 class="description">
                        The switchgear refers to the collection of the switching devices required for a low, medium or high voltage electrical circuit. It consists of switching and protection devices such as fuses, circuit breakers, isolators, disconnect switches, relays and other devices that control the flow of electricity.
                        These devices are used to switch the electric power on and off for transformers, motors, generators, transmission lines, and power networks in homes, commercial, industrial, transmission and distribution systems.</br>
                        The switchgear consists of two main components:<br/>
                        <b>Power switching/conducting component</b> such as a circuit breaker, fuse, or lightning arrester that can disconnect the flow of power when there is a fault.
                        <br/>
                        <b>Power control components</b> such as protective relays, control panels, current transformers and other devices to monitor, protect and control the power conduction components and the electrical equipment.</br>
                        The switchgears are used at various points of an installation. In the industrial setup, the switchgear controls the power to the manufacturing processes while at the utilities, the switchgear is used to run the electric grid. In commercial buildings, it is used to supply and control power to the loads while providing protection to the loads and the installation.
                        The switchgear permits the switching on and off of the generators, electrical equipment, transmission, distributors and other circuits during the normal operating conditions. However, under fault conditions, the switchgear is designed to detect the faults and interrupt the flow of electricity to the affected section, thus disconnecting and isolating it from the healthy circuit.
                        For efficient operation, the switchgear should be quick in operation and have an option of manual control to be used when the automatic feature is not working.
                        The switchgears are required at all switching points of an electrical network. The ratings of the devices at each stage depend on the voltage levels at that point. Other than in distribution and transmission networks, the switchgears are used in residential, commercial, industrial circuits.

                        <br/>The switchgears are classified according to the voltage levels involved in the circuit of application. The three classes are:<br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High voltage Switchgear</li>
                            <li>Medium voltage Switchgear</li>
                            <li>Low voltage Switchgear</li>
                        </ul>
                        Due to the dangerous voltages and currents that the switchgear elements carry, the access must be restricted in one form or another based on
                        the type of the facility. The switchgears are either outdoor or indoor. A fence with warning signs are used to restrict access to outdoor
                        substations, while metal enclosures and cabinets are used in commercial and industrial buildings to prevent the technical as well as public
                        from coming into contact with the live elements and parts.
